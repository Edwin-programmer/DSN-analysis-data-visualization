# DSN analysis and data visualization
Project: Analysis of Developer Social Network, Contribution Pattern and Link to Bug Incidence

This project demonstrates the steps involved using a case study gitlab project: Tiki Project
+ It produces results from data extraction and collection, Data clean-up, Data Categorization, Data Visualisation of developer contributions to the project.
I use Leiden Algorithm and temporal network parameters by defining edge data with source, target, and unique identifiers to view the contibution in time snapshots.

Overall, this result show is a supervised machine learning model and pattern useful for network groupings and developer recommendation for bug fixes
